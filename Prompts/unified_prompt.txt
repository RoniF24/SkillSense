You are generating ONE resume-style paragraph for an NLP dataset.

Goal:
Write a realistic resume paragraph that describes concrete work activities.
The paragraph is used to train a model to identify technical skills from text.

Context:
- role_family: {role_family}
- seniority: {seniority}
- responsibility_depth: {responsibility_depth}
- domain: {domain}

Skill specification (JSON dict: skill -> info):
[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

Each skill has:
- target_label: 1.0 (Explicit) or 0.5 (Implicit)
- aliases: list of acceptable explicit mentions (for 1.0 skills)
- required_evidence: phrases that MUST appear for 0.5 skills
- banned_terms: terms that MUST NOT appear for 0.5 skills (skill name + aliases)

Rules:
1) Output ONLY ONE resume-style paragraph of 4–6 sentences.
2) Do NOT mention any tool/skill that is not in the provided JSON dict.
3) For each skill with target_label = 1.0 (Explicit):
   - Mention the canonical skill name OR one of its aliases at least once.
   - It may appear multiple times (repeats are allowed).
4) For each skill with target_label = 0.5 (Implicit):
   - DO NOT use any banned_terms (no direct name/alias mentions).
   - You MUST include at least one phrase from required_evidence naturally in the paragraph.
   - Keep the evidence subtle (describe behavior/activities, not the skill name).

Style constraints:
- Natural resume tone (past tense).
- No bullet points, no JSON output, no headings.
- Avoid marketing language and buzzwords.
- Avoid these phrases (do not use them):
  “production-grade”, “world-class”, “cutting-edge”, “highly scalable”, “synergy”,
  “worked on”, “responsible for”, “in order to”, “various tasks”, “cross-functional”.

Now write the paragraph.
