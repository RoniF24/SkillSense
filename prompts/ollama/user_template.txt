You are an expert Data Scientist and NLP engineer.
You are helping me generate a synthetic dataset for an academic project called "Explicit-Implicit Skill Extraction".

TASK OVERVIEW
-------------
We want to train a model that receives:
- A short resume-style job role description (free text, a few sentences)
and predicts, for a CLOSED SET of skills, whether each skill is:
- EXPLICIT (value 1.0)
- IMPLICIT (value 0.5)
- NONE / NOT PRESENT (value 0.0)

DEFINITIONS (CRITICAL)
----------------------
For each skill:

1) EXPLICIT (value 1.0)
   - The skill name itself OR one of its aliases appears clearly in the text.
   - Example: For skill "Python", explicit evidence could be:
     "I work daily with Python and Django" or "Strong Python programming skills."

2) IMPLICIT (value 0.5)
   - The skill is NOT mentioned by name (no skill name and no alias),
   - BUT the text strongly implies that the person uses or knows that skill
     through tasks, technologies, or responsibilities that require it.
   - Example: For "Python", implicit evidence:
     "I build backend services using modern scripting languages and popular ML libraries"
     without saying "Python".
   - For cloud skills like "AWS", implicit evidence might be:
     "I deploy microservices to a major cloud provider using managed databases and object storage"
     without saying "AWS" / "Amazon".

3) NONE (value 0.0)
   - There is no strong explicit or implicit evidence in the text that the person has this skill.

THIS IS THE CORE NOVELTY:
-------------------------
The key research focus is distinguishing EXPLICIT vs IMPLICIT evidence.
Never confuse them:
- If the skill (or alias) is written by name in the text ⇒ EXPLICIT = 1.0.
- If it is only strongly implied but never named ⇒ IMPLICIT = 0.5.
- If there is no clear implication ⇒ NONE = 0.0.

GLOBAL SKILL LIST
-----------------
Below is the global skill list with categories and aliases.
You MUST treat this list as the ONLY allowed skills.

[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

(You can assume this structure is a mapping from canonical skill name
to a category and a list of text aliases.)

VARIETY REQUIREMENTS
--------------------
You will generate many independent samples.
Each sample represents a single "resume chunk" with a skill evidence vector.

Vary across samples:
- Role type: backend developer, QA engineer, data scientist, ML engineer,
  DevOps, full-stack, test automation, etc.
- Background: hands-on developer, team lead, manager, architect, SRE, etc.
- Seniority: "junior", "mid", "senior", "lead".
- Industry/domain: fintech, healthtech, ecommerce, cybersecurity, analytics, etc.
- Writing style: some more formal, some more casual, some bullet-like, some narrative.

SKILL SELECTION PER SAMPLE
--------------------------
For EACH sample you generate:

1) RANDOMLY choose between 3 and 6 DISTINCT skills from the global skill list.
2) For each chosen skill, decide a label:
   - "EXPLICIT" ⇒ numeric value 1.0
   - "IMPLICIT" ⇒ numeric value 0.5
   - "NONE"     ⇒ numeric value 0.0
3) You MUST generate the resume text so that it MATCHES the chosen label:
   - If label is EXPLICIT: the skill name or one of its aliases MUST appear in the text.
   - If label is IMPLICIT: the skill name and ALL its aliases MUST NOT appear in the text,
     but the responsibilities must strongly imply that skill.
   - If label is NONE: there should be no particular evidence for this skill.

OUTPUT FORMAT (IMPORTANT)
-------------------------
For each sample, output a SINGLE JSON object with EXACTLY the following fields:

{
  "skills": {
    "<CanonicalSkillName1>": 1.0,
    "<CanonicalSkillName2>": 0.5,
    "<CanonicalSkillName3>": 0.0
  },
  "resume_chunk_text": "A short resume-style paragraph of 4-7 sentences that matches the chosen labels."
}

Rules:
- "skills" is a JSON object where the KEYS are canonical skill names from the global skill list.
- The VALUES are numeric: 0, 0.5, or 1.
- Only include 3 to 6 skills per sample.
- "resume_chunk_text" must be consistent with the numeric values and the EXPLICIT/IMPLICIT definitions.
- The text must NOT mention any IMPLICIT skill name or alias.
- The text must mention all EXPLICIT skills using at least one of their aliases.
- Output MUST be valid JSON (double quotes, no trailing commas, no comments).
- Do NOT add any other keys (no id, no title, etc.).

SENIORITY & VARIANTS
--------------------
Please vary:
- junior vs mid vs senior vs lead
- individual contributor vs manager
- different combinations of backend, frontend, QA, data, DevOps, MLOps, etc.

Each sample must be self-contained and realistic as a short CV / resume description.
Length: 4-7 sentences is enough.

WHAT TO DO WHEN I ASK FOR N SAMPLES
-----------------------------------
When I ask you to "generate N samples", you will:
- Produce exactly N JSON objects, one per line (JSONL style).
- Do NOT add explanations, headers, or extra text around the JSON.
- Just output the JSON objects, each on its own line.
