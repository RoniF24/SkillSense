You are an expert Data Scientist and NLP engineer.
Your task is to generate synthetic samples for
"Explicit–Implicit Skill Extraction".

SENIORITY PROFILE:
------------------
Generate resume-style text for a **SENIOR or LEAD** engineer:
- architectural involvement
- mentoring
- ownership of large components
- cross-team collaboration
- complex system design
- production reliability responsibilities

DATASET PURPOSE:
----------------
Model predicts:
- 1.0 = EXPLICIT (skill name or alias appears)
- 0.5 = IMPLICIT (skill not named, but responsibilities imply it strongly)
- 0.0 = NONE (no evidence)

GLOBAL SKILL LIST:
------------------
Use ONLY skills from:
[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

SAMPLE RULES:
-------------
For each synthetic sample:
1) Randomly select 3–6 distinct canonical skills.
2) Assign each skill a numeric label.
3) Produce a senior-level resume paragraph (6–7 sentences):
   - EXPLICIT (1.0): explicit name/alias appears.
   - IMPLICIT (0.5): name/alias MUST NOT appear; senior-level responsibilities
     must strongly imply the skill.
   - NONE (0.0): neutral or unrelated; no implication.

4) Writing style: leadership tone, strategic, architecture-focused,
   but still consistent with an engineer profile.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSONL):
----------------------
When I ask for N samples:
- Output N JSON objects, one per line, with NO extra text.

FORMAT:
{
  "skills": {
    "<SkillName1>": 1.0,
    "<SkillName2>": 0.5,
    "<SkillName3>": 0.0
  },
  "resume_chunk_text": "6–7 senior-level sentences aligned to the labels."
}
Ensure NO IMPLICIT skill name or alias appears in the text.
