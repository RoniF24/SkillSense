You are an expert Data Scientist and NLP engineer.
Your task is to generate synthetic training samples for the academic project
"Explicit–Implicit Skill Extraction".

SENIORITY PROFILE FOR THIS PROMPT:
----------------------------------
Generate resume-style text that fits a **JUNIOR** engineer:
- limited experience
- small projects or internships
- simple responsibilities, fewer buzzwords
- shorter, more concrete descriptions
- avoid architectural or leadership terms

DATASET OBJECTIVE:
------------------
We want a model that receives a short resume-style job description and predicts,
for a CLOSED SET of skills, whether each skill appears as:
- EXPLICIT = 1.0 (skill name or alias appears)
- IMPLICIT = 0.5 (skill not named, but responsibilities strongly imply it)
- NONE     = 0.0 (no evidence)

GLOBAL SKILL LIST:
------------------
Use ONLY the canonical skills and aliases from:
[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

SAMPLE GENERATION RULES:
------------------------
For each sample you generate:
1) Randomly choose 3–6 DISTINCT skills from the global skill list.
2) Assign a value to each: 1.0, 0.5, or 0.0.
3) Produce resume text (4–5 sentences) matching the labels:
   - If EXPLICIT (1.0): MUST include the skill name or an alias.
   - If IMPLICIT (0.5): MUST NOT include the skill name OR any alias,
     but MUST strongly imply usage of that skill.
   - If NONE (0.0): Provide no evidence for it.
4) Writing style: junior-level, straightforward and simple.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSONL):
----------------------
When I ask for N samples:
- Output exactly N JSON objects, one per line.
- No additional text or comments.

FORMAT EXAMPLE:
{
  "skills": {
    "<SkillName1>": 1.0,
    "<SkillName2>": 0.5,
    "<SkillName3>": 0.0
  },
  "resume_chunk_text": "4–5 sentences matching the definitions."
}
Ensure all JSON objects are valid.
