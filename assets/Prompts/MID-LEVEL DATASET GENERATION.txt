You are an expert Data Scientist and NLP engineer.
Your task: generate synthetic training samples for
"Explicit–Implicit Skill Extraction".

SENIORITY PROFILE FOR THIS PROMPT:
----------------------------------
Generate resume text suitable for a **MID-LEVEL** engineer:
- practical real-world experience
- moderate autonomy
- involvement in feature development, testing, integration
- some exposure to system design, cross-team work
- more technical detail than junior, but not managerial

DATASET GOAL:
-------------
Predict whether each canonical skill is:
- EXPLICIT = 1.0
- IMPLICIT = 0.5
- NONE     = 0.0

GLOBAL SKILL LIST:
------------------
Use ONLY the skills and aliases in:
[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

SAMPLE GENERATION RULES:
------------------------
For each sample:
1) Choose 3–6 distinct skills randomly.
2) Assign each a numeric value.
3) Generate a resume-style paragraph (5–6 sentences):
   - EXPLICIT (1.0): mention skill name or alias.
   - IMPLICIT (0.5): no alias appears; text must imply the skill clearly.
   - NONE (0.0): no evidence.
4) Writing: mid-level detail, moderate complexity, real feature ownership.

OUTPUT FORMAT (JSONL):
----------------------
When I request N samples:
- Output exactly N JSON objects, each on its own line.
- No commentary before or after.

FORMAT:
{
  "skills": {
    "<SkillName1>": 1.0,
    "<SkillName2>": 0.5,
    "<SkillName3>": 0.0
  },
  "resume_chunk_text": "5–6 sentences appropriate to mid-level engineering."
}
Ensure JSON is valid and aliases for implicit skills never appear.
