You are generating ONE resume-style paragraph (4–6 sentences) for an NLP dataset: "Explicit–Implicit Skill Extraction".

Context:
- role_family: {role_family}
- seniority: {seniority} (Intern / Junior / Mid / Senior / Lead / Manager)
- responsibility_depth: {responsibility_depth} (IC / TechLead / PeopleManager)
- domain: {domain}

skills_info:
[PASTE_SKILLS_DICT_HERE]

STRICT RULES:
1) Output ONLY the paragraph (plain text). No JSON. No markdown. No headings. No “Here is…”.
STYLE RULES (VERY IMPORTANT):
- Do NOT start sentences with: "I have extensive experience", "I have gained experience", "In addition", "Furthermore".
- Write like a real resume: concrete actions + context, not self-descriptions.
- Avoid repetitive phrasing (do not reuse the same structure twice).
- Each skill should be mentioned/implied ONCE (do not repeat the same explicit skill multiple times).
- Do NOT include broken phrases or placeholders (e.g., "with and .", "and for", duplicated words like "pipelines ... pipelines").


2) Use ONLY the skills in skills_info. Do NOT add any new tools or skills.
2.1) Do NOT include responsibilities or descriptions that clearly indicate skills
     that are NOT listed in skills_info. Such responsibilities must be omitted.

3) If label is 1.0 (EXPLICIT): mention the canonical skill name OR one alias verbatim.

4) If label is 0.5 (IMPLICIT): DO NOT mention the canonical name NOR any alias verbatim;
   imply the skill via responsibilities only.

4.1) HARD CONSTRAINT:
- Every skill in skills_info MUST be reflected in the paragraph.
- If any skill is missing (explicitly for 1.0, or clearly implied for 0.5),
  the output is INVALID and must be regenerated.
- Do NOT use meta language (e.g., "not explicitly mentioned", "implies", "implicitly").
- Do NOT use generic placeholders such as:
  "a tool", "a service", "a platform", "a CI/CD tool", "a cloud service", "a production tool".

IMPLICIT SKILL GUIDANCE (CRITICAL):
When a skill has label 0.5, you MUST imply it using concrete, distinctive responsibilities
that would strongly suggest the skill to a domain expert.

Implicit skill definition (0.5):
A skill is labeled as implicit (0.5) if the canonical name and all aliases
do NOT appear in the text, even if the responsibilities strongly and clearly
indicate the skill to a domain expert.

The implication must be specific enough that a professional could infer the skill
with high confidence.

Examples of strong implication patterns (ONLY for skills that appear in skills_info with label 0.5 — otherwise AVOID these phrases entirely):
- You must use ONE concise implication per implicit skill (do not over-explain).
- For each implicit skill, choose ONE pattern and DO NOT copy the same phrasing across samples.

- GitOps (choose ONE): 
  * declarative config synced from a repo to environments
  * desired-state reconciliation with automated sync
  * version-controlled environment configs with drift correction

- CI/CD (choose ONE, and use the word "pipeline" at most ONCE in the whole paragraph):
  * automated build + test on merges with staged rollout
  * gated releases with automated checks before deploy
  * release automation with rollback plan mentioned briefly (no details)

- MLflow / MLOps (choose ONE):
  * experiment tracking + model registry + promotion between stages
  * reproducible training runs with versioned artifacts and staged deployment
  * automated validation checks before moving models to production

- Star Schema (choose ONE):
  * fact/dimension modeling for analytics queries
  * dimensional modeling to speed up reporting
  * reshaping data into facts and dimensions for BI

- Cloud Networking / Load Balancing (choose ONE):
  * subnet routing / security rules for service connectivity
  * request distribution with health checks and failover routing
  * traffic routing rules controlling paths between services

- Kafka (choose ONE):
  * producers/consumers with topic partitioning
  * event streams with throughput/ordering constraints
  * message ingestion with partitions and consumer groups

- NLP (choose ONE):
  * tokenization/normalization + lightweight text classification
  * preparing labeled text data + evaluating precision/recall
  * building simple text processing rules and validating on samples

IMPORTANT (STRICT):
- If CI/CD is NOT in skills_info: do NOT mention ANY of the following terms or ideas:
  pipelines, pull requests, merges, build-and-deploy, release gates, deployment gates,
  rollbacks, continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated test stages.
- If a CI/CD tool (e.g., GitHub Actions / Azure DevOps / Jenkins / GitLab CI) appears in skills_info,
  CI/CD-like wording is allowed ONLY if CI/CD also appears in skills_info (0.5 or 1.0).

5) Realism by seniority:
   - Intern/Junior: small/medium tasks, no leading architecture, no mentoring or leading a team.
   - Mid: own features/services, occasional cross-team collaboration.
   - Senior/Lead: system design, reliability/performance, mentoring allowed.
   - Manager: people/process ownership and delivery; keep technical mentions realistic.

6) Avoid invalid associations:
   - Selenium is for UI automation testing, NOT for backups or failover.
   - Backups and failover are described as managed database operations
     or infrastructure configuration.

7) NEVER explain or comment on skills.
   - Do NOT use meta language such as:
     "implicitly suggests", "this implies", "without explicitly mentioning",
     "although I did not mention", "suggests expertise".
   - The paragraph must read like a real resume, not an explanation.
   - If you explain why something implies a skill, the output is INVALID.

8) Responsibility depth enforcement:
   - If responsibility_depth = IC:
     * DO NOT mention leading teams, mentoring, managing people, or overseeing others.
     * Allowed: owning components, implementing features, collaborating with other teams.
     * Any leadership or management wording makes the output INVALID.
   - If responsibility_depth = TechLead or PeopleManager:
     * Leadership and mentoring are allowed, but must stay realistic to seniority.

9) No metrics:
- Do NOT include numbers, percentages, or hard performance claims (e.g., "30%", "2x", "millions of users").

Now write the paragraph.
